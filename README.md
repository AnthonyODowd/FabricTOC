# FabricTOC

This repository is a working area for the Hyperledger Fabric Documentation Workgroup to develop the Table of Contents (TOC) for the Administration guide section of the Hyperledger Fabric documentation https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

It's purpose is to facilitate collaborative development of the  Administration Guide section of the documentation, such that it can be included in the Hyperledger Fabric documentation repository.

It uses markdown to help documentation developers easily edit and view their changes on their local machine, while maintaining source control through GitHub.

We recommend using ATOM (https://atom.io/), or editors with similar previewing facilities, to help develop this content.

The Administration Guide is [here](./docs/AdminGuide/AdminGuide.md)
