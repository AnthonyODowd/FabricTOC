# <a name="HowOrganized"></a> How this Information is organized

We have group the tasks in this section in groups that relate to the conceptual model of Hyperledger Fabric. For example, you'll find all the commands relating to Certificate Authorities under the same section, all the tasks relating to Peers under another section, and so on.

With any of these sections, we'll order the tasks in the same way as you'd expect to issue them, if that's possible.  For example, [Starting a Peer](./PeerTasks.md#StartingPeer) is listed before [Joining a Channel](./PeerTasks.md/#JoiningChannel).
