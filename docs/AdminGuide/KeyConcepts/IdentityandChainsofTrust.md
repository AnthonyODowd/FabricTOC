# Identity and Chains of Trust

Identities really matter in a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network! That's because a principal's **identity determines the exact permissions over resources in a blockchain network**. As well as **verifying** the information in a digital certificate, blockchain components who use a principal's identity also have to **recognize** the source of that trusted information. These two concepts -- verification and recognition -- combine to provide **trusted identities** in a blockchain network,  **Certificate Authorities** and **Membership Service Providers**.

## What is a Certificate Authority?

As you've seen, an identity is brought to the blockchain network by a principal in the form of a cryptographically validated digital certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA). CAs are a key part of the internet when it comes to security, and you've probably heard of some of the more popular ones: Symantec (originally Verisign), GeoTrust, DigiCert, GoDaddy, Comodo, and so on.  

The digital certificate provided by a CA for a principal incorporates the principal's public key, and a comprehensive set of their attributes. It is indeed elegant that CAs themselves have a certificate, which they make widely available, so that consumers of the CA's certificates can easily verify their origin. Consumers can verifying ceritificates from a CA by verifying that certificate hash could only have been generated by the holder of the corresponding private key -- the CA. (Remember that in modern systems, a private key is only ever held by a principal throughout the key's entire lifecycle, and CAs hold their private keys more securely than most.)

If you're interested, you can read a lot more about CAs [here](./), but for now you should think of them as the components who issue digital certificates that convey a principal's identity.

### Root CAs and Intermediate CAs

As an aside, CAs come in two flavours: Root CAs and Intermediate CAs, and you've already seen some of the most popular **Root CAs** - Symantec, GeoTrust, etc. It's beucase RootCAs have to **securely distribute** hundreds of millions of identities to internet users that is makes sense to distribute that process to **Intermediate CAs**, who actually often provide the certificates under the authority of the RootCA from which they establish their authority.  This is called a **Chain of Trust**, because organizations will almost always use Intermediate CAs, which have been signed off on by the trusted Root CA (or by a chain of Intermediate CAs leading back to the Root CA).

| A Chain of Trust is established between a Root CA and a set of Intermediate CAs using a simple chain. Many other configurations are possible according to the needs of multiple consuming organizations.|

Intermediate CAs provide a huge amount of flexibility when it comes to the issuance of certificates across multiple organizations, and that's very helpful for a permissioned blockchain.  For example, you'll see that different organizations may use different RootCAs, or the same RootCA with different Intemediate CAs Many combinations possible. One Intermediate CA could exist for all orgs or every org can have its own Intermediate CA -- it really does depend on the needs of the network.


Intermediate CAs behave exactly like Root CAs, but an Intermediate CAs identity certificate is signed by another CA. certifcates are   

For example, a large organization may establish an intermediate CA   

Never want to use (ie expose) the Root CA. It's is like the private key of the CAs. But it is -- crucially -- trusted by all (just as a SSN is "trusted" by all). Organizations will almost always use Intermediate CAs, which have been signed off on by the trusted Root CA (or by a chain of Intermediate CAs leading back to the Root CA). Many combinations possible. One Intermediate CA could exist for all orgs or every org can have its own Intermediate CA. Depends on the needs of the network.

Notes:

All Hyperledger Fabric CA servers in a cluster share the same database for keeping track of identities and certificates. If LDAP is configured, the identity information is kept in LDAP rather than the database.

Unless the Fabric CA server is configured to use LDAP, it must be configured with at least one pre-registered bootstrap identity to enable you to register and enroll other identities.


So far, so good  -

well-known authorities who are the key parts of the internet, they provide  


Nothing about a Fabric network can function unless components trust each other's identities and the permissions those identities entitle them to. Establishing that trust means creating *digital certificates* which can be verified against a shared trust store of identities.

Those certificates are created by a component we call a Certificate Authority (CA) using public keys (which are self-generated from a component -- or user's -- public/private keys).

This is not dissimilar from how identity works in the real world. Think of your private key as being roughly analogous to a Social Security Number. It's too dangerous to expose directly as a regular form of identity, but it can be used to generate other identities -- a driver's license, for example -- which is issued by a trusted source (the DMV). This driver's license is like your public key -- still private, but used to grant permissions (like the right to drive) and to generate other identities (like a library card).

In a Fabric network, the CA -- which is trusted by the network -- takes the place of the DMV and issues you a digital cert. And just as the driver's license is used as a proxy for identity (while also conferring explicit privileges like the right to drive), the digital certs issued by a CA confer not just identity but rights to perform network functions or over network components.




*(Other things I'm not sure about: How are you brought into the network originally (how are those certs generated, from where, where are they stored, what happens to them). And then how are they used by you in two different ways: 1) to execute certain functions. How are they tested? Who tests them? Where do they test them? What exact identity are you using (is it a global ID or does it just go back to the root CA to check it). And 2) how is this identity used to get new privileges and how and where is that update stored (such that it can be checked out when you want to perform that action)).*

You're now going to focus on four components the blockchain, and how they establish a **chain of trust** in order to help them determine which principals have permission over different network resources. As you saw in [](./),

In this topic you'll see how **a chain of trust** must be established by four of the major components in a blockchain network -- the peers, orderers, channels and the network itself.

For example, if a peer wants to determine whether a connected application can update a ledger, it uses the channel policy to look up the permission associated with the application's organization.

As you've also seen, an identity is brought to the network by a principal in the form of a cryptographically validated digital certificate issued by a Certificate Authority.  Ad as we've seen, a Hyperledger Fabric blockhain network can only function when components trust principal's identities. There are two parts to establishing trust, specifically **digital certificates** and the identification of which can be verified against a shared trust store of identities.
