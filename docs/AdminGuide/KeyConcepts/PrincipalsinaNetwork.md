# The Principals in a Network

Three types of principals: users (which can also be an organization, or "entity"), roles, and organizational units.


## Organizations, Organizational Units, Roles, and Members

The ability to *read* relegates an org to a passive role in the network. Reading orgs receive ledger updates, query the ledger, and can join channels, but they don't participant in endorsement, can't administer, can't propose transactions (including configuration transactions), and can't instantiate chaincode.

Write permissions add the ability for an organization to propose transactions and install chaincode (though the ability to instantiate that chaincode is left to an administrator). Writers also can participate in endorsement (depending on the specific endorsement policy on a particular channel).
