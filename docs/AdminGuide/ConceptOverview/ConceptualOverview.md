# Conceptual Overview

Fabric networks are complex, interdependent systems whose administration encompasses not just the initial configuration and bootstrapping of the network but also its adaptation and expansion as new organizations and participants are added to it.

In this administration guide you’ll learn about the scope of what we call “network definitions” and how a Fabric network is established, managed, and can be modified, including:

1. How Fabric networks are organized as “groups within groups”.
2. What a "consortia" and “organizations” actually are and how to add organizations to a consortia.
3. How digital certificates are used to identify what we call “principals” and how permissions define not just what the principals in a Fabric network can do, but what they actually *are*.
4. The nature of access control and policies. How policies change depending on the type of principal they apply to, how we change policies, and even how we change the policies for changing policies!
5. How the network is actually bootstrapped, including the establishment of the initial configuration block (also known as the "genesis block").
6. The creation and maintenance of channels, peers, and chaincode.
