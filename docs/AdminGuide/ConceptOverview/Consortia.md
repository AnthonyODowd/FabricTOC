# Consortia

## What is a Consortium?

An independently managed group of users is known as an *organization*. A car manufacturer, for example, or a bank. A group of these organizations operating a Fabric network is called a **consortium**. This term separates consortia conceptually from components like the orderer which is a part of the network but not made up of users.  

## Adding Consortia to the Network Definition

The consortium -- and the organizations within in it -- are defined by the administrator(s) in the initial network configuration. The rights and permissions of these organizations are defined by the *consortium policy* and are divided into four possible levels of permissions: *read*, *write*, *administer*, and *modify*.

The consortium in DRIVENET will first be comprised of the founders and first organizational members of the network, Mitchell and Regal. Later, Cecil's Car Dealership, ZBS Insurance, the DMV, and Faster Autos will join the DRIVENET consortium.
