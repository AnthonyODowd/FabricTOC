# Consortia

## What is a consortium?

An independently managed group of users is known as an *organization*. A bank, for example (assuming regulations do not force its various wings to act independently from each other), would join as an organization (or *org*). A group of these organizations operating in a Fabric network is called a **consortium**. This term separates consortia conceptually from components like the orderer which is a part of the network but not made up of users.  

## Adding consortia to the network definition

The consortium -- and the organizations within in it -- are defined by the administrator(s) in the initial network configuration and added when the network is bootstrapped. The rights and permissions of these organizations are defined by the *consortium policy* and are divided into four levels: *read*, *write*, *administer*, and *modify*.

More on these roles in [-->Principals in a Network](./PrincipalsinaNetwork.md).

## DRIVENET consortia

The consortium in DRIVENET will first be comprised of the founders and first organizational members of the network, Mitchell and Regal. Later, Cecil's Car Dealership, ZBS Insurance, the DMV, and Faster Autos will join the DRIVENET consortium (each having different levels of administrative rights).
