# Conceptual Overview

This is the first section you should read if you're completely new to blockchain or Hyperledger Fabric.  It will assume that you don't have any knowledge of either of these topics, and that you want to ultimately understand how to administer a blockchain network based on Hyperledger Fabric.

There are quite a few concepts relating to administering a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain!  Don't be daunted however - you'll start with high level concepts like networks and organizations, and gradually work through to the major concepts.  Some of these concepts are a little tricky when you first read them. That's because we're trying to agree how to administer a network that is **shared by** and **shared across**,  many organizations. However, you'll get plenty of examples, and references to a concrete example that you can try out called **DRIVENET** to help make these concepts real.
