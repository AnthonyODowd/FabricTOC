# Key Concepts

This is the first section you should read if you're completely new to blockchain or Hyperledger Fabric. It will assume that you don't have any knowledge of either of these topics, and that you want to ultimately understand how to administer a blockchain network based on Hyperledger Fabric.

There are quite a few concepts relating to administering a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain! That's OK, because you'll start with high level concepts like networks and organizations, and gradually work through other major concepts with plenty of examples along the way. Specifically, you'll see the concepts explained in terms of a concrete example, that you can try out, called **DRIVENET**. (More on DRIVENET later.)

Some of these concepts may seem a little tricky when you first read them. That's because you're learning how to administer a network that is **shared by** and **shared across** many organizations. You'll see that what Hyperledger Fabric does is very powerful in this regard, and rest assured, you'll be able to understand it once you've read and grasped the concepts and solidified your learning with the worked example.

There are two major sections to the Key Concepts section: the Network and Channels. Each section has both unique concepts and concepts that are common to both.
