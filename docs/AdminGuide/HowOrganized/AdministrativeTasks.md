# Administrative Commands

This section of the guide describes all of the commands relating to administering a Blockchain network. The commands are grouped by the concept to which they relate - for example, all the commands on administering smart contracts are grouped together, as are all the commands on access control for different users.

For each command, you'll see a brief description of the command, followed by a syntax diagram for that command specifying all the options. There will also be an example of the command with the options completed using paramters that would make sense in the DRIVENET sample network.  In this way, you'll be able to see a working example, wherever possible.
