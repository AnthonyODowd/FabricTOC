# Administrative commands

The section is the most frequently used by Blockchain administrators. If you're learning Hyperledger Fabric or blockchain for the first time, then you'll start with Concepts or the DRIVENET sample, but once you're experienced in this, this is the section you'll use time and time again.

Blockchain administrators will use this section whenever they need to be reminded of command details, or when they need to understand detailed command options.  Use this section when you're comfortable with the concepts, and you're trying to administer a real network. If you're just learning, then try out these commands on the DRIVENET sample network.

## Grouping of commands

There are a lot of commands that are available in Hyperledger Fabric.  To make it easier to find the command you need, they are grouped according to the concept to which they relate. For example, all the commands on to administer smart contracts are grouped together, as are all the commands on access control policies, and so on.

## Understanding each command

For each command, you'll see a brief description of the command, followed by a syntax diagram for that command specifying all the options. There will also be an example of the command with the options completed using parameters that would make sense in the DRIVENET sample network.  In this way, you'll be able to see a working example of a command in a realistic context.
