# Administrative Commands

This section is for use by blockchain administrators on a regular basis whenever they need to be reminded of command details or understand different command options that might be available.  It makes most sense to use this when you're comfortable with the concepts, and are trying to administer a real network, even if it's only the DRIVENET sample network.

The commands in are grouped according to the concept to which they relate. For example, all the commands on to administer smart contracts are grouped together, as are all the commands on access control policies.

## Command Details

For each command, you'll see a brief description of the command, followed by a syntax diagram for that command specifying all the options. There will also be an example of the command with the options completed using parameters that would make sense in the DRIVENET sample network.  In this way, you'll be able to see a working example of a command in a realistic context.
