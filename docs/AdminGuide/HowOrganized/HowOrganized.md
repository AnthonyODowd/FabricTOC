# How the Administration Guide information is organized

We classify all information into concepts, tasks or reference material.

**Concepts** are the key ideas you need to understand if you want to be able to administer a blockchain network.  For example, you need to understand what a blockchain network is, a channel, peers, orderers and other things. The concepts are the things that will help you really understand what you're trying to do and why you're doing it when you administer a blockchain network.  If you're learning about Hyperledger fabric or blockchains for the first time, and you're an Administrator, then it's vital that you start here.  

**Tasks** are the things you can do when you administer a blockchain network.  After you've understood the key concepts of Hyperledger fabric, you'll want to see how to do the things you've learned.  For example, you might want to define a network and then bootstrap it, or modify a network's definition, or join a peer to a channel. On a day-to-day basis, these tasks are the meat and drink of a blockchain administrator.

**References** are everything else - the detail.  It's the information that the experts use to configure their network "just so".  For example, if there's an option that allows you to specify a specific consensus mechanism for the network (there is) then it will be listed here. You'll need a solid understanding of blockchain concepts and tasks before lots of this material makes sense to you, but it's perfect when you do.
