# How the Administration Guide is organized

## Audience

This section of the documentation guide is for **blockchain administrators** who need to **understand**, **configure**, and **manage** a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.

Because a blockchain network runs across many organizations' infrastructure, it is called **decentralized**. The administration of the network necessarily involves administrators from multiple organizations and the different rights and privileges they have over the network. This is probably quite different to what you've seen before as an administrator, and makes this guide an essential reference for you.

## Concepts, Tasks and References

Documentation topics are designed to match your needs and experience. Topics will either be a **Concept**, a **Task** or a **Reference** topic depending on whether it's introducing a new idea, showing you how perform a specific task, or giving you more detailed information about a subject.

## New Administrators

If you're new to Hyperledger Fabric, then you'll want to spend time understanding the [Concepts](./_), and then reinforce this knowledge with a working example by trying out the [DRIVENET sample](./).

## Experienced Administrators

Alternatively, if you're an experienced user, or you've become familiar via the introductory material, you'll mostly want to use the [Administrative Tasks](./) section to perform common tasks, or the [Reference Material](./) to select detailed options for commands or component configuration.

## Glossary and Links

Finally, if you want to look up a concept or term you've heard about relating to Hyperledger Fabric, there's a [Glossary of Terms](./) that helps you to do this. It gives you a definition and links to the relevant sections of the documentation to understand more, or an external link, as appropriate.
