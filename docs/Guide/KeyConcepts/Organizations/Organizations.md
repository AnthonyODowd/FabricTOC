# Organizations in a network


## The Initial Organizations

The concept of the network "founder" or founders (or "initiator", or whatever we're calling this role now). How many can do this? How do they get the information together? What is the approval process (from the perspective of a network admin, not a lawyer or businessperson).


The Blockchain administrator for the founding organization(s):

- Defines a network name.
- Defines a consortium for the blockchain network
- Defines a set of organizations in the consortium

Questions that must be answered:

- Which organization will start the network?
- Which organizations will participate in the network?
- What permissions will each organization have when managing the network? Rights over administration will generally be shared, but not always.
