# Administrative commands

Rather than force experienced blockchain admins to pour through the DRIVENET sample for command details or to find a conceptual understanding of those options, this section will excerpt those commands and their usages in an easy-to-use and easy-to-find format.

If you're learning Hyperledger Fabric or blockchain for the first time, you should start with Concepts or the DRIVENET sample, but once you're experienced in this, this is the section you'll use time and time again.

## Grouping of commands

There are a lot of commands that are available in Hyperledger Fabric.  To make it easier to find the command you need, they are grouped according to the concept to which they relate. For example, all the commands on to administer smart contracts are grouped together, as are all the commands on access control policies, and so on.

## Understanding each command

For each command, you'll see a brief description of the command, followed by a syntax diagram for that command specifying all the options. There will also be an example of the command with the options completed using parameters that would make sense in the DRIVENET sample network.  In this way, you'll be able to see a working example of a command in a realistic context.
