# How this Guide is organized

## Audience

This section of the documentation guide is for **blockchain developers and blockchain administrators** who need to **understand**, **program**, and **administer** a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.

Because a blockchain network runs across many organizations' infrastructure, it is called **decentralized**. The programming and administration of a blockchain network necessarily involves multiple organizations and the different roles and privileges they have over the network. This is probably quite different to what you've seen before as an programmer or administrator, and makes this guide an essential reference for you.

## Concepts, Tasks and References

Documentation topics are designed to match your needs and experience. Topics will either be a **Concept**, a **Task**, or a **Reference** topic depending on whether they are introducing a new idea, showing you how perform a specific task, or giving you more detailed information about a subject, respectively.

## Introduction Topic

This topic will give you an overview of Hyperledger Fabric blockchains.  It's the perfect place to start if want to build your blockchain knowledge.  Don't worry if it's all totally new to you - this topic will give you a high level introduction and gently get you started on your journey, whether that's as a blockchain developer or administrator.

## New Administrators and New Programmers

If you're new to Hyperledger Fabric, then you'll want to spend time understanding its [Concepts](./_), and then reinforce this knowledge by trying out examples in the [Samples and Tutorials](./) topic.

## Experienced Programmers

If you're a more experienced Hyperledger Fabric developer, or you've become familiar via the concept material, you'll mostly use the [Developing blockchain applications](./) and the [API Reference](./) topics for blockchain development.  These topics provide a comprehensive guide to writing blockchain applications and smart contracts.

## Experienced Administrators

Alternatively, if you're an experienced Hyperledger Fabric administrator, or you've become familiar via the concept material, you'll mostly want to use the [Administering a blockchain network](./) and [Command Reference](./) topics for blockchain administration. These topics provide a comprehensive guide to all the tasks and commands available to blockchain network administrators.

## Glossary, Links and Other Reference Material

Finally, if you want to look up a term you've heard about relating to Hyperledger Fabric, there's a [Glossary of Terms](./) that helps you to do this. It gives you a definition and links to the relevant sections of the documentation to understand more, or an external link, as appropriate.

There's lots of other material in the reference
